          Hi, I'm Stephanie! <br />
          From a very young a age hair has always been one of my passions. I've
          been doing hair for 6 years now, I love to continue my education to
          keep up with trends. what I do doesn't feel like a job, I love putting
          a smile on peoples face, listening to what's going on in their life's.
          My job is my hobby, favorite past-time and valued quality time with
          people I admire and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is thatevery client receives an outstanding service from the
          time they walk in, to the time they walk out. I want my cliens to love
          my work so much that they would refer me to their friends, their
          famil, and even complete strangers who approach them anywhere. My
          mission is to create a place where everyone feels confortable and
          welcome!
